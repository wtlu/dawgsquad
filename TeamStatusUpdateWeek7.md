## This Week's Progress ##

This week the D.A.W.G. Squad mainly focused on our beta release of SharingMedia. Though hectic, D.A.W.G. Squad managed to get many of the functionalities of SharingMedia working, such as Adding a Book, Finding a Book, and My Library section of the program. Throughout the week there has been a difficult problem of getting Facebook login and authentication to work, but we eventually solved the problem and login is working as intended. Unit and Integrated test were also implemented to test our application. SRS, SDS, User, and Dev Documentation were also updated to reflect changes made to our program (as well as updating the documentation to be more readable). Our team currently has developed into 4 developers (James, John, Ken, and Troy), 3 testers (Greg, Jedidiah, Tatsuro), and PM (Wei-Ting).

Although the week was pretty stressful for the whole team, we felt it was a great learning experience, and are excited to finish our application.
