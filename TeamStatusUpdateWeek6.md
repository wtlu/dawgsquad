## This Week's Progress ##

This week the D.A.W.G. Squad mainly focused on redesigning our class diagram and database schema due to our change to MVC and CakePHP. We also received feedback to our SDS and talked in detail with our customer (Punya) about the feedback, as well as getting feedback on our new reworked class diagram and database schema.

The team also redefined our team structure as we realized how CakePHP is worked, and what our requirements is for our Beta release. The team is now divided into 4 main developers who consist of Troy, John, James, and Ken. They are backed by two testers, Jedidiah and Tatsuro. Greg is in charge of integration testing, and Wei-Ting is in charge of managing the team.

There were some slowdowns, however. We did not get to update the SRS and SDS due to lack of time and trying to study for midterms. We did learn more CakePHP, and have a skeleton file structure with all the files needed to develop our application. Actual coding will start next week.
