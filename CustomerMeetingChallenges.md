# Customer Meeting Challenges #

Here are some of the issues that were raised during meetings with our customers about the product requirements, and  issues that we raised when acting as the customer for another group

### Meeting 4 - 4/7/2011 - Customer Meeting (Punya) ###

Punya raised a few issues regarding our product requirements. One issue was in regard to what type of application our project will be, whether it will be a Facebook app, or whether it will be a LAMP-based web app. Punya noted it will be important to make a decision now, as the planning and development for our application will be dependent on the platform we use. Another issue that Punya raised was in regards to similar applications. He noted that our application needs to do something that can differentiate itself from the competition. The rest of the issues raised were more or less in regards to finer implementation details of our project, such as the scope of our application, what system to host our web page and code, how do we input ISBNâ€™s, and ensuring our Google Documents are made live such that they can be more accessible to others.

### Meeting 5 - 4/8/2011 - Customer Meeting (Lab Medicine #1) ###


This meeting with our client was very beneficial. They raised some good points.

  * The first point was: How are users going to get information into the application?
> > We then discussed different options such as, taking pictures of bar codes on a smartphone, entering the ISBN manually, or entering title and author information and searching for the appropriate book.

  * The second point was: This application is similar to other book sharing applications on Facebook. Perhaps you should include the ability to buy/sell books.
> > We decided this was a good idea, and that we will have that option available to users. Instead of just being able to share books, users can negotiate a price or trade for a book. This will require additional features that we weren't planning on implementing, but feel that the result will be a unique, highly useful Facebook app.



### Meeting 6 - 4/8/2011 - Lab Medicine 2 Meeting ###

When we met with Lab Medicine 2, we raised several concerns, including:
  * The cost and benefit scanning barcodes on many items versus one barcode for many items
  * HPAA compliance
  * Barcode generation and printing
  * Driver reliability issues (adjusting for data entry failure, etc.)

It's important to determine the granularity of barcode-ing because as more barcodes are generated for any given set of items, the complexity and cost in scanning increase, which can lead to error. Conversely, if too few barcodes are generated, items might get lost in packaging, and there would be no way to track them. HPAA compliance wasn't an issue because the application doesn't have to be HPAA compliant. We discussed whether it would be better to encode information in barcodes, or use pre-generated barcodes that are linked to a database of shipment information. Also, we talked about how to manage the risk associated with driver reliability, and whether or not there were software solutions to correct for that risk.
