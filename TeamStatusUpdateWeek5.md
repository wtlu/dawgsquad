# Team Status Update - Week 5 #

## Last Week's Goals ##

Last week, D.A.W.G. Squad planned to:
  * Look into Facebook API and PHP (Everyone)
  * Create Documentation for Users (Ken, Tatsuro, John, James)
  * Create Documentation for Developers (Wei-Ting, Troy, Jedidiah, Greg)
  * Finish Zero Feature Release (Everyone)
  * Meet with Punya for Customer feedback (Everyone)
  * Maintain Google Code website/wiki (Wei-Ting)

## This Week's Progress ##

This week the D.A.W.G. Squad mainly focused on creating and finishing the Zero Feature Release and its User and Developer documentations. The team created SharingMedia application through Facebook, and was able to get an initial webpage finished using CakePHP with Ken's server.

The team was divided in half to work on the documentation for the zero feature release. Ken, Tatsuro, John and James worked on the user documentation, while Wei-Ting, Troy, Jedidiah, and Greg worked on the developer documentation. The whole team also tested our install instructions and debugged an install script for a new CSE VM machine.

The whole team met up on Thursday night to work together on a CakePHP tutorial. This was an important step as it allowed everyone in the team to set up their individual servers to test their code when they actually start development. It also allowed the whole team to take the time and learn a little bit about CakePHP. Through the tutorial, we also understood the MVC framework better and realized we need to redesign our class diagrams and database schema.

The team also decided that it would be better to move our server to Amazon Web Service instead of relying on Ken's home server. While we thought it would be appropriate to use Ken's server to develop the ZFR, due to down times, we decided that using AWS would be a safer approach for future development (as well as for future scalability of SharingMedia, when more users start using our service and use up more bandwidth). We met up with our customer (Punya) to make sure we were on track with our ZFR, as well as getting approved on using AWS for our project.

The team as a whole worked every well together this week, and did not encounter much problems.
