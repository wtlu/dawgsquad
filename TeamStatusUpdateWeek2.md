# Team Status Update - Week 2 #
## This Week's Progress ##

This week the D.A.W.G. Squad was formed, and we designed and refined our idea for SharingBooks. This week also served as a “set-up” week where everyone got together to set up the tools the team was going to use for this project. The team got together, exchanged contact information, created a mailing list as well as a calendar set up to ease communication in the future. Team roles were discussed and assigned. John, Greg, Tatsuro, Wei-Ting, and Ken would focus on the front-end architecture of the project while Troy, Jedidiah, and James would focus on the back-end infrastructure. The team also selected Wei-Ting to become the project manager, who would act as the communication link between the team as well as the link with our customers. The team also met up to set up software tools for use in our project. A Google Code page was set up, which would contain our repository, bug tracking software, as well as general information of our project. The group also met up to set up Mercurial and Crystal.

The team then divided itself into smaller sub-teams to create a set of software requirements specification (SRS). James and Jedidiah worked on the product description, John and Ken worked on the UI Diagrams, Greg and Tatsuro worked on the use cases, and Troy and Wei-Ting worked on the process description. After talking with our customers (Punya, team Jtacck) we decided use Facebook as the front-end platform of choice. We also met with team LabEX to hear their idea and gave our feedback to them.

The team as a whole worked every well together, and did not encounter much problems this week.
