My goals from last week were:
  * Present a portion of our PowerPoint presentation to the class
  * Become familiar with CakePHP
  * Work with the “Controller” team on the zero feature release of our application
  * Implement an installable app from Facebook

This week I familiarized myself with CakePHP and worked on getting it set up on my computer. I also worked on the User Documentation as part of our Zero Feature Release. Finally, I also helped the team to redesign our software architecture to properly follow the Model View Controller model. I ran into many challenges this week, most notably in getting CakePHP set up on my computer, and reworking out software architecture. It took a while for me to understand the MVC model, and even still, my understanding of MVC may be lacking in some arftctoals for next week are:
  * Learn more about MVC, get brushed up some more on PHP
  * Begin working on the implementation for the beta release
    * I will be grouped with another member to work on some key feature of the app; delegation will be decided in the near future
    * In most cases, I plan on picking back up on PHP as I go

PMy goals from last week:
I set uo
  * Participate in our power point presentation
  * Learn CakePHP
  * Start building the business logic for our application.
  * Work with the other teams to get our zero release completed.

This week I focused on getting ready for our power point presentation and learning CakePHP. I set up XAMPP and CakePHP on my machine and went through the Cake cookbook and tutorial. I played mostly a support role for the ZFR, helping somebody if they asked, and reviewing content to make sure it was in accordance with the assignment spec. We did not start building our business logic because we had to make major modifications to our architecture to support the MVC model. I was a little surprised at how long it took to get the CakePHP framework up and running on our personal machines. Many group members had issues here. Eventually, everybody was on the same page.

My goals for next week:

  * Start implementing my assigned module.
  * Start looking at best method for testing my code.

My goals from last week were:

  * Compile team status report (week 4) for turn in
  * Learn PHP and CakePHP
  * Create a demo Facebook Application
  * Work with Controller team to get some business logic completed
  * Complete Assignment 5 with my group members

This week I turned in the team status report. I met with my group to finish the Zero Feature Release. I mostly worked on getting the steps to make the application on Facebook. I also created the demo Facebook Application as well as getting our ZFR onto our current Facebook page. I also looked over the Zero Feature Release before I turned it in for consistency check. We tested the install script using a fresh VM, and debugged for problems. I also installed XAMPP and did a CakePHP tutorial to get me familiar with the framework.

My goals for next week are:

  * Compile team status report (week 5) for turn in
  * Rework SRS and SDS
  * Start implementing feature of Adding and Finding Books for the Beta release

**James Parsons**

My Goals from last week were:
  * Write scripts for setting up the BookSharing Database
  * Coordinate with front end to make sure we have a working set of specific database operations
  * Consider the specific details of the queries and SQL statments that will be needed by the front end (controller) and begin writing them (at least 3 done this week for zero feature release).


Some of these goals become n/a after our team decided to move to a model view controller architecture, so this week a large amount of time was spent drawing up diagrams describing our MVC architecture. I wrote the directions for developers for our zero feature release, and also helped write the user view for the user documents. After our MVC plan was fleshed out, I studied a cakePHP tutorial to become familiar with the framework, and created a set of skeleton files as dictated by our design docs, to be completed as we begin serious coding.

For next week:
  * Participate in team delegation of features to be coded.
  * Write the first iteration for one our application's features, I tenatively plan to work on the "Add Books" functionality, and have it working.

**Jedidiah Jonathan**

My goals for last week are:

  * Participate in the Powerpoint presentation in class.
  * Work with James to setup the MySQL Database for the zero feature release. (High Priority) This was not satisfied as I was learning to use CakePHP, so Troy worked on setting the DB script up.
  * Take on any new tasks to ensure that the team is on track for the zero feature release.

CakePHP documentation and first tutorial to setup the CakePHP framework was probably was the biggest tasks for me this week. And also reviewing and editing the User and Developer documentation.

My goals for this week are:
  * Participate in re-working the SRS and SDS to match the current decisions the team made.
  * Work towards any tasks assigned by the team for the beta release.

**Greg Brandt**

My goals from last week	were to
  * Write a splash page for the application's ZFR
  * Read	CakePHP	documentation
  * Start developing our	content	generation mechanism using CakePHP

I read the CakePHP documentation and went through the tutorials, set up the
CakePHP framework in our repository, and wrote the splash page for the ZFR. I
also helped initiate the reconfiguration of our	SDS to be compatible with the
MVC framework, although	I couldn't make	the meeting during which we worked on
the details of this process. I also became more	familiar with LAMP technology,
especially Apache when working on scripting our	build mechanism	with the team.

My goals for next week are to
  * Contribute to the reconstruction of our SDS
  * Implement and test any features assigned to me for the beta release
