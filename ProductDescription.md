## Introduction ##


**SharingMedia** is a Facebook application that enables its users to share, trade, or sell books they own with friends across their social network. The type of books being shared can range from novels to textbooks. SharingMedia appeals to the very large user base of anyone who owns books and is willing to share, trade, or sell their books, and/or anyone who is looking for a specific book and would like to quickly and easily find the product at a great price, or even borrow it from a friend without spending a dime. SharingMedia aims to reduce the cost of purchasing increasingly expensive books when titles desired are within an existing social network. SharingMedia promotes deal making between consumers in order to leverage the vast amount of books that we all own and yet are rarely using, while simultaneously leveraging the existing social network within Facebook to provide an instantly connected user base.


## SharingMedia Promotes: ##

  * **Buy/Sell/Trade** - Exchange a variety of books amongst friends and colleagues
  * **Save Money** - Small and frequent transactions without the overhead and cost of a 3rd-party merchant
  * **Use of Preexisting Social Network** - Utilizing an already established social network such as Facebook helps promote and make our product easy to use amongst friends.
  * **Spatial Locality and Shared Interests** - Friends on Facebook tend to live in the same area, and friends tend to share interests, further increasing the odds of a useful trade.


## Major Features that SharingMedia provides: ##

  * **Social Connection** Connect user to friends and colleagues to collectively share books. Allows the user to easily and quickly search book collections of friends, and then setup an agreement for the loan/sell/trade of books to the user.

  * **Track your Library** Provides a means for the user to quickly add and update a list of books for others on the service to access.

  * **Search for Books** - Search through our database for books you're trying to find.

  * **Browse for Books** - Browse through our database for books that your friends currently are offering.

  * **Bartering System** - Users can barter with other users on items they want to trade, sell, or loan. Once an item is requested by one user, both users are presented with a messaging system through which they can haggle with each other.

## How does SharingMedia work? ##

Each user will add the book(s) that they own and are willing to share, trade, or sell. As other user find the book, they might initiate a transaction to buy, borrow, or trade the book.

## Competition to SharingMedia ##

SharingMedia competes successfully with some major competitors by providing a wide variety of the services it offers: loan, share, trade, and sell. SharingMedia also boasts in the idea of barter system unlike some of its competitors that have a fixed time constrains for loaning the books out. SharingMedia works on the principle that at any given time, a user is only using a small number of the books that they own; the app efficiently allows these idle resources to be taken advantage of, rather than collecting dust on a shelf.

Some of the major competitors of SharingMedia are:

  1. **Craigslist**
    * Advantages:
      * Very large user base
      * Wide variety of items to share
    * Disadvantages:
      * Rarely are the items free
      * Haphazard and unstandardized information, often vague about important details, "Wild West" of online shopping

  1. **Pubic Library System**
    * Advantages:
      * Free service for loaning media
      * Centralized and large user base
    * Disadvantages:
      * Limited time-frame for the loan period, after which the user is fined
      * No functionality for purchasing or trading items
  1. **CollegeSwap**
    * Advantages:
      * Free service for loaning media
      * Facebook app to allow access to all your friends

  1. **Bookshare Books**
    * Advantages:
      * Free service for listing books for archive purposes
      * Users can rate books, write reviews, see other friends' library of books
      * Facebook app to allow access to all your friends
    * Disadvantages:
      * Users cannot buy, trade, lend, or sell books, merely look at other people's collection of books, or adding a book.
      * Limited for just books (novels/non fiction).

How does SharingMedia standup to these challenges?
SharingMedia:
  * Gains the large user base by being a Facebook app.
  * Provides a selection of items that are closer to user's friends collection of books (probably by matching courses for textbooks and interests for other books)
  * Does not have a centralized location of storing books, so when friends are trading or sharing the books the wait time can be avoided.
  * With the bartering system, the owner and the potential book borrower or trader can negotiate with the owner and avoid the time constrains that public libraries enforce.
  * Provides a wide variety of options like share, buy-sell, trade, and loan that are under one roof for the users.


## Bonus Features (possibly in version 2.0): ##
  * Expansion beyond books into other items, such as DVD's, video games, and other physical media.
  * Inclusion of "Wanted" section, where users can post wanted ads for items that they are seeking.
  * Photographic barcode recognition to allow users to use webcams to scan ISBN's of books for adding or searching book.

## Non-Functional Requirements: ##
  * Interface Requirements
    * SharingMedia will be using the existing Facebook APIs for its frontend interface for the user. It needs to stay consistent with Facebook API.
  * Performance Requirements
    * Security - SharingMedia will not disclose any personal information to either other users are the rest of the facebook world. The users will be given an options to share how much information they want with potential book owners or friends.
    * Reliability - SharingMedia will maintain the integrity of the information provided by its users.
