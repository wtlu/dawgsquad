**John Wang**

My goals from last week were:
  * Learn more about MVC, get brushed up some more on PHP
  * Begin working on the implementation for the beta release
    * I will be grouped with another member to work on some key feature of the app; delegation will be decided in the near future
    * In most cases, I plan on picking back up on PHP as I go

This week, I worked on the Book model, BookController controller module, and the AddBook and AddBookSearchResult views. I have gotten down the ability to search our database and the Google Books API, and return properly formatted results. I will need to wait for BookInitialOfferController to be finished before I can continue work on ConfirmAddBook, FindBook, and FindbookSearchResult views.

My goals for next week are:
  * Complete ConfirmAddBook view, and work on FindBook, and FindbookSearchResult views for beta release.
  * Fix bugs with my controller and views.
  * Perform other “maintenance” tasks such as updating documentation as necessary.

**Greg Brandt**

My goals from last week were to
  * Contribute to the reconstruction of our SDS
  * Implement and test any features assigned to me for the beta release

I was assigned to integration testing for the beta release. I have started working on
developing tests for the Transaction module and	the Add	Book use case. However,	the Add
Books isn't coming along as fast because we	have to	get	the modules it depends on mostly
implemented first. I didn't really get much else done because I	was busy studying for
the midterm (and another midterm in another class).

My goals for this week are	to
  * Implement the majority (at least as far	as I	can) of	the Transaction	unit test
  * Implement the Add Books use case system test

**Wei-Ting Lu**

My goals from last week were:

  * Compile team status report (week 5) for turn in
  * Rework SRS and SDS
  * Start implementing feature of Adding and Finding Books for the Beta release

This week I turned in the team status report. I met with my group to divide the work up for the beta release. We also met up to redo our class diagrams after noticing our MVC framework does not support our current implementation. Although the SDS and SRS were going to be redone by James and Jedidiah, after dividing the work up between other members, it became clear that it would be better if I edited and updated the SDS and SRS. Though I did not have much time to work on it due to midterms in this and other class.

My goals for next week are:
  * Compile team status report (week 6) for turn in
  * Work with my teammates to finish the beta release. Try to support the dev and testers as much as I can
  * Rework SRS and SDS
  * Turn in Assignment 6

**James Parsons**

My goals from last week:
  * Participate in team delegation of features to be coded.
  * Write the first iteration for one our application's features, I tenatively plan to work on the "Add Books" functionality, and have it working.

I did participate in the delegation of team features to be coded. I am now a developer, and over the past week implemented much of the functionality behind "add initial offer", which is a component of the "Add Books" use case. I also corrected several bugs in the database setup scripts.

For Next Week:
  * Complete book initial offer and styling of pages to help match our UI design.
  * Work with Jedidiah to update our SRS document for the Beta Release Assignment.
  * Begin work on implementing the views and controller for the "Transaction" use case.

**Ken Inoue**

My Goals from last Week:
  * I will help with the beta release by working on the view.

> I started working on the beta release over the weekend but due to mid terms and others commitments I was not able to code as much as I would of liked. I also had some difficulty getting cake to do what I wanted it to do.

For Next Week
  * Complete the Library views and required functions in the controller
  * Get a better understanding of cakephp. Lack of understanding is slowing me down.

**Troy Martin**

My goals from last week:

  * Start implementing my assigned module.
  * Start looking at best method for testing my code.

This week I was involved in the architecture restructuring. Our architecture at the time was not conducive to the MVC model, so we refactored our class diagram into clear, well defined models, controllers and views. We then restructured our team to support developing and creating test scripts in parallel. I am a developer and have already started creating the user model, controller and linked them to the "index" view which is acting as our main page.  I also started the main template and user authentication for our app.

My goals for next week:

  * Finish my module for the beta release
  * Help the group get our beta release ready

**Jedidiah Jonathan**

My goals for last week were:

  * Participate in re-working the SRS and SDS to match the current decisions the team made.
  * Work towards any tasks assigned by the team for the beta release.

The SRS was reviewed and I re-read them per the feedback by the TA. Also this week was spent in reading the documentation for the CakePHP Testing since the team assigned me as one of the testors. I have tried to get the Test to work on my local machine, but have had some problems with that due to just MAMP issues. Just fixed them tonight by reading some online tutorials.

My goals for next week are:

  * Implement the Unit Testes for one controller (Book\_initial\_offet\_controller)
  * Update the SRS live document.

**Tatsuro Oya**

My goals from last week were:
  * Learn CakePHP
  * finish Zero Feature Release

This week, we discussed our team structure and I was assigned to do unit test for one of the modules in our controllers. Therefore, I started learning how to test on cakePHP. I also updated the Use case diagram so that we now have one more view class (MyTransaction).Other than that I studied for our midterm.

My goals for next week are:
  * Learn unit testing on CakePHP
  * Complete unit test for BookController
  * post Bug Report
