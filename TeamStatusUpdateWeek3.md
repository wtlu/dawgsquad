# Team Status Update - Week 3 #

## Last Week's Goals ##

Last week, D.A.W.G. Squad planned to:
  * Refine idea for UI and finish paper prototype (Everyone)
  * Look into Facebook API and PHP (Everyone)
  * Refine front-end architecture (John, Greg, Tatsuro, Wei-Ting, Ken)
  * Refine the back end infrastructure (Troy, Jedidiah, and James)
  * Maintain Google Code website/wiki (Wei-Ting)

## This Week's Progress ##

This week the D.A.W.G. Squad mainly focused on creating and finishing the paper prototype. Much of the meetings we had this week were devoted to flushing out our UI from SRS document. One of the challenges was getting everyone to agree to a common user interface. It turned out everyone in the group had a little different idea of how our SharingBooks applications worked, and it showed when we argued with each other on what kind of user interface to create. Although in the end, everyone was able to compromise and decide on a agreeable interface that turned into the paper prototype.

We then met with our customer Team Jtacck on Friday. Although Kevin Anderson and Andrew Lau were the only group members that saw our interface (the other team members of Jtacck were preoccupied with being another groupâ€™s customer), we got a significant amount of feedback from the team in terms of how our application worked. The paper prototype exercise ended up taking the whole class period, and we had a lot of good data that we used to refine our UI when we met again on Sunday.

Some of the team members got a little exposure to the Facebook API and PHP, but the team needs to come together and get comfortable with Facebook API before we start code development.

The team as a whole worked every well together this week, and did not encounter much problems.
