# Meeting 15 - 4/21/2011 #

Time: 5:00pm - 6:00pm

Location: CSE021

Participants: Wei-Ting, Tatsuro, Greg, Troy, Ken, Jedidiah

## Agenda ##
  * Create UML User Interface Class

## Updates ##
  * Thanks to T.A.â€™s advice, we decided to add User Interface class to our UML class diagram.
  * Worked on and added new features to our UML class diagram.
    * What we have done for our class diagram only contains controller part. So we discussed how we can add User Interface part into our use case diagram.
    * To do this, we first organized high level view of our entire architecture and came up with the idea of what we need for our UI view. ![http://dawgsquad.googlecode.com/hg/docs/UML/highLevelView.png](http://dawgsquad.googlecode.com/hg/docs/UML/highLevelView.png)
    * Then we created the prototype diagram of User Interface view. ![http://dawgsquad.googlecode.com/hg/docs/UML/protoUI.png](http://dawgsquad.googlecode.com/hg/docs/UML/protoUI.png)
    * Based on this, we created and add class diagram for User Interface.
  * We also talked about the other staffs which are listed in the following section.

## Notes ##
  * For now we have decided to use CakePHP for our web frame work
  * Definition of front end and back end changed: controller is now part of back-end.
  * We will have some people move to back end because business class is part of the back-end class

# Meeting 14 - 4/21/2011 #

Time: 4:30pm - 5:00pm

Location: CSE002

Participants: Wei-Ting, Tatsuro, Greg, Troy, Ken, Jedidiah, Punya(Customer)

## Agenda ##
  * Feedback on the UML class Diagram from Punya.
  * Team asks Punya any other questions on their mind. Create UML User Interface Class


## Notes ##
  * Coding Standards:
Punya suggests that we could use an already existing PHP framework for the UI. For example: use already existing Plug-ins for using textsearches instead of spending time writing all that code.

  * UML Class Diagram
Team out of sync with how the class diagram talks to the UI. Team begins to talk about modifying the Class Diagram.

## Action Items ##
  * Iterate over the SDS doc that is due on Friday night. Each member has to complete tasks assigned.
  * Team will meet at 5:00pm to talk about Modules in the UML Class diagram that should be there.
