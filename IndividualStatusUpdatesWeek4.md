**Ken Inoue**

Last week I plan to meet with front end to work on the UML diagram and help the team work on the design of the app and finish the presentation by Friday.

I helped write the UML Diagram and wrote the testing procedure for the process paper. I also helped write the presentation.

This week I will help write scripts for the 0 feature release and read up on cake php. I will also setup accounts on my server for team members

My goals from we were to spend some additional time going over the Facebook API, and to work on the software architecture and process documents for assignment 4. As a member of the front end team, I planned to help do the class UML diagrams and sequence diagrams for the software architecture. Finally, I agreed to continue updating the UI diagrams as necessary.

This week, I worked intensively with my team on writing the SDS documentation. Admittedly, I felt we were a little overwhelmed at first, but after getting down to business we had things planned out properly, and the process went relatively smoothly. For my share of the SDS documentation, I mostly helped work on the UML class diagrams. I also assisted my teammates in drafting and creating the sequence diagrams. For the process documents, I assisted in planning and writing the project schedule, and creating the timeline of our milestones.

My goals for next week are as follows:
  * Present a portion of our PowerPoint presentation to the class
  * Become familiar with CakePHP
  * Work with the “Controller” team on the zero feature release of our application
    * Implement an installable app from Facebook

**Troy Martin**

My goals from last week were:


  * Work with the back-end team to complete the database architecture.
  * Help to complete the process details for the design assignment due on Friday.
  * Help to complete the diagrams (Class/Sequence).
  * Help to complete power point presentation.

This week I really focused on helping my group get the architecture assignment done. After thoroughly analyzing the best design for our application, we decided to switch to a model, view, controller (MVC) architecture. This architecture turned out to make more sense than our original plan. It clearly defines the logic between the front-end and the back-end. It was also decided that I would be working on the controller team moving forward.

I worked with the model team (ex back-end team) and helped outline the schema for the database and the associated tables in a E/R diagram. I collaborated with my teammates on the sequence diagrams. I also did the risk assessment and team structure parts of the write-up.

My goals for next week:

  * Participate in our power point presentation
  * Learn CakePHP
  * Start building the business logic for our application.
  * Work with the other teams to get our zero release completed.

**Jedidiah Jonathan**

From last week I updated the Product Description based on the Feedback we received from Punya. Also actively attended and participated in all the software team meetings for the team. The week was very intensive in working towards creating the SDS documentation and the presentation slide deck for the same.Worked with James and Troy to generate the High level database schema and the corresponding E/R Diagrams, which were later presented to the team for approval.

The team assigned me the task of working on parts of the Test plan: Unit Testing and Integration Testing. I could come up with a rough draft for this from my experience in CSE 303 and the team later gave me feedback on these which went through some phases of modifications to be sucessfully completed. I also was actively engaged in reviewing the parts of the document that the other team members had written and gave some constructive feedback regarding the same.

My goals for this week are:
  * Participate in the Powerpoint presentation in class.
  * Work with James to setup the MySQL Database for the zero feature release. (High Priority)
  * Take on any new tasks to ensure that the team is on track for the zero feature release.

**Greg Brandt**

My goals from last week were to
  * Work on the UML Sequence Diagrams
  * Work on some of the Process documentation
  * Practice PHP

I attended the meetings during which we developed the UML Sequence Diagrams. I also wrote pseudo code for the two use cases that they covered. I did the high-level system architecture diagram. I also reviewed and revised various parts of the SDS as they were being completed, and updated the wiki. I looked into the Facebook and Google Books APIs and found documentation for several functions that our application will be using. I also continued to practice PHP while developing for a friend's small business.

My goals for next week are to
  * Write a splash page for the application's zero feature release
  * Read CakePHP documentation
  * Start developing our content generation mechanism using CakePHP

**Tatsuro Oya**

My goals from the last week were:

  * Learn PHP
  * Looking at Facebook API

This week I worked in group to finish up uml diagrams required for the assignment 4. We first discussed what we need for our UML class diagram. Then, using the 2 scenarios from our use case, we discussed 2 cases of  uml sequence diagrams. After organizing our idea, I created these diagrams using visio studio. I also started learning PHP. Also, we figured out that we can use CakePHP for our web framework.


My goal for the next week is:

  * learn CakePHP
  * finish Zero Feature Release

**James Parsons**

My goals from last week were:

  * Work with Back End team to describe database schema
  * Help create sequence diagrams once architecture is outlined
  * Take on at least one document in the Process subheading of assignment 4 and complete
  * Work to create our powerpoint presentation before Friday

This week I met with our team each day except Friday to work on completing assignement 4. Myself, Jedidiah, and Troy discussed at length the necessary data for our database, as well as how to structure the tables in order to easily map to the data model in the front end. We created a database schema. I drew up the Database Model Diagram using MS Visio, and wrote a summary of the database structure. I also helped the team understand how the use cases related to operations on the database, for the sequence diagrams.

For Next Week:
  * Write scripts for setting up the BookSharing Database
  * Coordinate with front end to make sure we have a working set of specific database operations
  * Consider the specific details of the queries and SQL statments that will be needed by the front end (controller) and begin writing them (at least 3 done this week for zero feature release).

**Wei-Ting Lu**

My goals from last week were:

  * Compile team status report for turn in (Monday and Tuesday)
  * Turn in Paper Prototype Reflection
  * Learn PHP
  * Create a demo Facebook Application
  * Help with UML Sequence diagrams with front-end group
  * Help write some of process description
  * Complete Assignment 4 with my group members.

This week I turned in the team status report as well as the paper prototype reflection. I met with the the group everyday except Monday due to an employer interview. I worked with the team extensively with the SDS document to finish on time. I mainly worked on the team schedule, documentation, and coding conventions. I also researched on different PHP Frameworks and decided to promote CakePHP to my group members since it had the most documentation and tutorials. It also helped us create new notions of team structure (Model, View, Controller). At the end of the week, I looked over the whole SDS document and presentation, fixing inconsistencies and turned it in.

My goals for next week are:

  * Compile team status report (week 4) for turn in
  * Learn PHP and CakePHP
  * Create a demo Facebook Application
  * Work with Controller team to get some business logic completed
  * Complete Assignment 5 with my group members
