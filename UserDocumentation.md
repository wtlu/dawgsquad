## What is SharingMedia? ##
SharingMedia is a Facebook application that enables users to share, trade, or sell books they own with friends across their social network. Our application appeals to the very large user base consisting of anyone who owns books and is willing to share, trade, or sell their books, and/or anyone who is looking for a specific book and would like to quickly and easily find the product at a great price, or even borrow it from a friend without spending a dime. SharingMedia  aims to reduce the cost of purchasing increasingly expensive books when titles desired are within an existing social network. SharingMedia promotes deal making between consumers in order to leverage the vast amount of books that we all own and yet are rarely using, while simultaneously leveraging the existing social network within SharingMedia to provide an instantly connected user base.

## SharingMedia - A User View Description: ##

The SharingMedia UI and user experience is a streamlined version of other online selling and trading websites, such as Amazon and eBay. If you have used such services the SharingMedia interface will feel familiar, and if not it is simple and easy to learn. Our application specifically aims to allow you to search our service for books, and then perform transactions to buy, sell, loan, and trade books owned by other individuals in your Facebook social network.

The primary activities of SharingMedia are: adding books you own to your library, searching for books you want, performing transactions and making offers, and utilizing your personal library to track your books and any outstanding loans. To make these actions simple and intuitive, our user interface is organized around four simple pages, each of which allows you to perform a different activity. The pages are accessed by set of navigation tabs, and include:

### The My Library Page: ###
> The My Library page contains a list of the books that you own, a list of transactions you are currently involved in, a history of completed transactions, as well as a list of loaned books that conveniently track when the book is due to be returned.

### The Find Books Page ###
> The Find Books page allows you to search and browse the books owned by others in your social network. Using these results, you can then initiate transactions with the owner of the book you want with a click of the mouse.

### The Add Books Page ###
> The Add Books page allows you to add new books to their library, by either entering the ISBN or the Title and Author of the book. These new additions will then be available for other users to view and search.

### The Transaction Page(s) ###
> Our transaction system is designed to mimic how a real world transaction between two individuals may occur, with the goal of helping guide both parties to an agreement by providing a more structured approach. Thus, the transaction system should feel natural, and the structured set of options for each approach adds a sense of formality to each transaction made.
> The transaction pages allows you to propose offers of cash, trade, or loan to the owners of other books in order to obtain new books, or conversely to consider offers from other users  and either accept or reject offers, or even to propose a counteroffer.

_More information on the details of the use of each described Page can be found below under the heading “How to Use SharingMedia”._
