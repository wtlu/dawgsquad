**Jedidiah Jonathan**

This week was spent in working with James to finish the Product Description, actively participating in the Paper Prototype exercise, and just briefly playing with crystal and mercurial tools.
Defining various terms in the Product Description was a very good learning experience, in terms of understanding the smaller details of what the purpose of the product was. I missed the meeting where the team worked on the paper prototype, which was a blessing in disguise as I acted as the user (first time with the UI) in our next project meeting. But since I knew a lot of the features that our project was implementing and how we were doing it, the paper prototype exercise (in the project meeting) was not really helpful. Later in class when I saw another team's member as a user for our prototype, I learnt so much about how we could do things in our project differently, from just simple words in the UI that seemed confusing to actual features that the user could not grasp with us explaining it to them.
I attended the project meeting on Sunday, to work with our team to fix parts of our paper prototype from the feedback we got from the user and then make plans for working on the SDS.

Things to do:
  * 1. Update the Product Description (Part of the SRS)
  * 2. Meet the Backend Team to come up with Schema for the backend process.
  * 3. Work with the team to finish the SDS (doc and pres) .. specific tasks will be finalized on Tuesday 4/19.

**Tatsuro Oya**

My goal from the last week were:
  * learn PHP
  * looking at Facebook API.

This week, I manly worked together with our group thinking about our user interface since we need to show it to our customer on Friday. When we are having meetings on Sunday, Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday, we discuss what our UIs are like how our customer reacts when we see our UIs. Other than that I also started reading for some website describing Facebook API.

Next week, as a front end team, I will work on designing UML class diagram first. Then, start thinking about UML sequence diagram to get a detailed idea of how our architecture is. Also, I will continue researching Facebook API and PHP.

My goals for the next week are:
  * Finish UML, architecture and comptele Assignment 4
  * Learning PHP
  * Learn Facebook API

My plans from last week were to work with our team on prototyping our product and to do some research on development with the Facebook API.

This week, I helped my team design and draw the prototype mockups. On Friday, I helped to collect feedback from our customers about our prototype. Overall, the prototypes were successful, and we received a lot of good feedback regarding where we can improve with our application. I also received a lot of feedback and suggestions on what we need to do to update our UI diagrams, and I have already gone ahead and made some of the changes. I also spent some time to look over the Facebook API. The API has some interesting calls that can be made to easily access information from user profiles. Additionally, I looked over some of my past projects and assignments to get myself brushed up again on PHP.

I felt that I could have spent more time reviewing past material and learning the Facebook API. As such, I will need to spend some additional time going over those so that I can be ready when it comes time to code. Additionally, I will be working on the software architecture and process documents for assignment 4. As a member of the front end team, I will need to help do the class UML diagrams and sequence diagrams for the software architecture. Finally, I will continue helping update the UI diagrams as necessary.

**James Parsons**

Goals from Last Week:
  * Refine our feature set and UI, in order to gain a clearer understanding of what we are planning to build (Complete)
  * Working through use cases with the customer, and trying to imagine the ways in which the user will want to use our service (Complete)
  * Spend some time exploring a typical architecture for a Facebook app (Pending)

My work this week included discussing and creating the paper UI Prototype, participating in the customer meetings in order to gain insight into the areas of our UI that needed to be fixed, and updating the Product Description to reflect the learning that occurred during the UI Prototype creation and customer meeting. Our discussion concerning our UI was highly useful, and helped us focus our UI around our core use cases (adding books, trading books, and searching for books).

The customer meeting yielded excellent feedback, the most useful in my opinion was 1) the comments about the add books process, which the customer thought was hard to navigate (which I have since suggested be streamlined into a 4 page guided pipeline of search->confirm result->state price->add to library), and 2) the comments about the fact that our system for keeping track of loaned books was rather vague, and so the UI was updated to include an explicit page for this purpose.

For Next Week (All focused towards completing assignment #4):
  * Work with Back End team to describe database schema
  * Help create sequence diagrams once architecture is outlined
  * Take on at least one document in the Process subheading of assignment 4 and complete
  * Work to create our powerpoint presentation before Friday

**Troy Martin**

My goals from last week were as follows:

  * Start looking at Facebook API
  * Get familiar with PHP
  * Look at what our database options are for the back-end and start the architecture.
  * Help with paper prototype

The main focus of my efforts this week were getting the paper prototype designed and built. This required about 3 group meetings, where we really tried to focus on making our UI as intuitive as possible. This was very challenging, something I did not fully anticipate. I thought what each group member felt was an intuitive design would be very similar. It turned out that everybody had significantly different ideas about how to make our UI design intuitive for the customer. I also completed the evaluation of the requirements and the paper prototype of the group for which we were customers. Overall, I could tell that LabEx put a lot of effort into their paper prototype. Ken (who was interacting with their prototype) and I (who was taking notes) and had only a few suggestions for how they could make their product even better.

This week I also started becoming familiar with PHP, which is the main language we'll use for writing our application. I am in CSE190, and we are doing a PHP webpage for our homework asssignment.

On Monday I have a meeting with the back-end team, where we will be discussing in detail, the database architecture. We will design our schemas and tables, to determine how and what information will be stored and made available by our front-end Facebook application.

I realize now that looking at the Facebook API was a pre-mature goal and also not a proirity for the back-end team. However, I do plan on getting familiar with the API at some point.

For next week:

  * Work with the back-end team to complete the database architecture.
  * Help to complete the process details for the design assignment due on Friday.
  * Help to complete the diagrams (Class/Sequence).
  * Help to complete power point presentation.

**Ken Inoue**

Goals for next week,

learn how to program using the Facebook API and create UI for a Facebook app. Work on paper prototype

This week I read a little about developing Facebook apps. Need to read more before starting the app. I also helped with the paper prototype and was the user for lab 2 paper prototype.

This week I plan to meet with front end to work on the UML diagram and help the team work on the design of the app and finish the presentation by Friday.

**Greg Brandt**

My goals from last week were to go over the Facebook API and refine our use cases to better reflect the new trading system.

I read through documentation on the Graph API, and am more familiar with the Facebook information query process. However, I didn't really get a chance to look through the actual PHP API calls. I didn't personally refine the use cases to better reflect the new system, but I took part in our discussion after the paper prototype exercise that helped to do so.

I will contribute to the UML sequences for two use cases for Assignment 4. I will also take on a portion of the Process documentation. I'll volunteer to do a lot of the Test Plan (if no one else has any strong preference). I will also continue practicing PHP.

**Wei-Ting Lu**

My goals from last week were:

  * Compile homework for turn in (Monday and Tuesday)
  * Start and try lay out most of front-end architecture of project
  * Complete the paper prototype with my group members.
  * Look into and learn Facebook API
  * Learn PHP
  * Upkeep the wiki

This week I started out by compiling all of assignment 1(SRS document) and the team status report and turned them in. I maintained the wiki and transferred all our SRS document from Google Docs into the wiki. I worked with my group members to finish the paper prototype. We finished on Thursday, did a few test runs, and prepared for Friday with our customer. I felt we received great feedback from our customer who took a first look at our UI, and gave us a lot of good suggestions. One of the challenges this week was agreeing on a UI for the paper prototype as we fleshed it out from the SRS documents. I also took a look at the Facebook API and learned a little bit about how the API works.

My goals for next week are:

  * Compile team status report for turn in (Monday and Tuesday)
  * Turn in Paper Prototype Reflection
  * Learn PHP
  * Create a demo Facebook Application
  * Help with UML Sequence diagrams with front-end group
  * Help write some of process description (Risk Analysis)
  * Complete Assignment 4 with my group members.
