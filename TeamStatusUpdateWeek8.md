## This Week's Progress ##

This week the D.A.W.G. Squad mainly focused on our feature complete release of SharingMedia. This week was focused on getting the “Transactions” and “Loans” functionality working, as well as developing the test suite for the software. The rest of the week was also focused on fixing all the bugs from the beta evaluations we got from Team Jtacck. Though hectic, D.A.W.G. Squad managed to get all of the functionalities of SharingMedia as described in our SRS and SDS working. Unit and Integrated test were also implemented to test our application, but towards the end of the week, the developers made changes to the code that it broke many of the unit tests that the testers created. This was due to our team being divided into developers and testers, and did not have a proper communication, so when developers decide to change the specification, it broke the tester’s code.

SRS, SDS, User, and Dev Documentation were also updated to reflect changes made to our program (as well as updating the documentation to be more readable).

We also had a chance to perform beta evaluations for LabEx, but had an extremely hard time trying to properly evaluate their product. The main problem was that their documentation was too vague that it was hard for us to follow and properly test. Although we pleaded the group to update their documentation, and were able to test the user side of the product, in the end, we couldn’t properly test the developer section of their beta.

Although the week was pretty stressful for the whole team, we felt it was a great learning experience, and are excited to finish our application.
