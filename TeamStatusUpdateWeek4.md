## This Week's Progress ##

This week the D.A.W.G. Squad mainly focused on creating and finishing the Software Design Specification. The team split the SDS into smaller sections and collaborated with each other to finish each of the components. A class diagram, sequence diagram, and database schema were created for SharingBooks application, as well as an updated process document.

During this process of writing the SDS, it also became clear that we needed at PHP Framework to make our development easier on the long run. We decided to use CakePHP due to the vast amounts of documentation available for the framework, as well as great support if we need assistance. We also decided to switch to a model, view, controller (MVC) architecture to accommodate our framework, and also changed our team structure to reflect the architectural change. We now have the Model Team (Jedidiah, James), the Controller Team (Wei-Ting, Troy, John, Tatsuro), and the View Team(Greg, Ken).

One of the challenges we faced this week was actually deciding on what our class diagram should be. At first some group members though it was unnecessary to include UI elements in our diagram. However, after consulting with our TA-customer Punya, it became clear that our initial class diagram was really the business logic behind our product, and that we needed additional class diagrams to illustrate the connection between the business logic, the UI, and the database.

Some of the team members got a little exposure to the Facebook API and PHP, but the team needs to come together and get comfortable with Facebook API before we start code development.

The team as a whole worked every well together this week, and did not encounter much problems.
