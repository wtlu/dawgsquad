Last week I planned to meet with our customers, and then use the feedback to write the product description document in collaboration with Jedidiah. I also planned to help the team refine our product idea.

I was able to meet with our TA customer (Punya), as well as with the team for whom we act as customers. Using their suggestions, Jedidiah and I wrote the product description document. We as a team held discussions in order to more narrowly define our product, and decide to expand the service to allow buying, selling, trading, and loaning of books. We also decided to use a Facebook app as the frontend to our service. Finally, we also spent some time setting up google code/mercurial/crystal, as well as syncing up our google calendars to facilitate meeting planning.

For next week, I plan to help to more concretely refine our feature set, and UI, in order to gain a clearer understanding of what we are planning to build. This will also include working through use cases, and trying to imagine the ways in which the user will want to use our service. This effort will be directed towards completing our assignment #3. I would also like to spend some time exploring a typical architecture for a Facebook app, since I am unfamiliar with developing for it.

Last week, my goal was to nail down the project requirements along with my team. Additionally, I planned to learn about some of the technologies that we will be using for our project, such as the Facebook API.

This week, I worked with my team members to come up with the product description. My team member Ken and I drew a few mockups for the UI of our application.  A main challenge that appeared was that our team discovered a few applications that were fundamentally similar to ours. As such, we had to modify our product description, which in turn required that we modify the rest of our documents, including our UI. Ultimately, the task of designing and drawing the UI mockups was not particularly time consuming. Nevertheless, it was still challenging to create a UI that would be user accessible, and also be functional, at the same time. I learned a good amount this week regarding the early design stages of software development and what it takes to be a part of a successful software development team. While it was harrowing at first to have to work with the team to constantly modify our product description in order to differentiate our application from other products, I felt we eventually came through, and have the necessary groundwork for future developments.

For the coming week, I plan to work with our team on prototyping our product. I also plan to do some research on development with the Facebook API.

My goals from last week was to get into a group and start looking into the software tools that we’re going to need to use in the future (regardless of which project we end up working). Since getting into the group and setting up the project, my goals became to finish our SRS requirements and getting to know what our product really is (and get those requirements).

The main focus of this week was to meet with our team members and figure out what our product was really going to do. I volunteered to be the project manager, and my job this week was really to set up general communications between team members and other teams. I created a Doodle and a mailing list for our group to communicate with each other, as well as a place to set up meetings and for archive purposes. I attended the majority of the meetings, and met with two customers (TAs and Lab Specimen #1). We also set up the software tools such as Mercurial, Crystal, and Google Code to get used to working with those software. We collaborated on our Requirements assignment using Google Documents. I felt meeting with the group was a great way to get work done, and setting up the repository and getting software to work was able to be completed sooner because we’ve met. I worked together with Troy on the Process Description, but felt I did not contribute much other than editing due to work from other classes. I felt I should have contributed to the team more, but due to lack of time management, I ended up not contributing as much as I hoped to have. From this week, I learned how important meeting up with our team and our customers to get our idea down, and being able to time manage is important to the success of our product.

Next week my goals are to:
  * Compile homework for turn in (Monday and Tuesday)
  * Start and try lay out most of front-end architecture of project
  * Complete the paper prototype with my group members.
  * Look into and learn Facebook API
  * Learn PHP
  * Upkeep the wiki

I’m excited to be working with our group, and am looking forward to next week.

**Ken Inoue**

(No actual goals set as this was first week). My original plan for the begining of the week was to set up code repository and code page as well as help mock up the UI for the project.

I set up the Google code page for the project and installed and configured totise hg as well as crystal on my computer. I also helped write the original spec for sharing books before we realized our product was similar to something that already exsits. I also helped design the UI for the original project and the new project.

Goals for next week,
  * o learn how to program using the Facebook API and create UI for a Facebook app.
  * work on paper prototype

**Tatsuro Oya**

My goal for the last week was to think more about our project to finish Assignment 2.  Also, my personal goal was to become familiar with the tool that we use for our project.
We had several meetings and talked about the more detailed product description. I also looked up some similar application to our project.  Thanks to our group members and TA’s help, I was able to understand how Mercurial works. The followings are the things I done for the last week.


  * Wrote use case for create/delete account but deleted later due to change in requirement
  * Wrote use case for finding book
  * Set up Mercurial and learned basic usage.

The main goals for this week is to start learning PHP and looking at Facebook API.

The main focus of my efforts this week was in completing the process description. This required getting feedback from all group members, as there are many aspects of the process description that affect all members. The process description also required figuring out a reasonable schedule/timeline, classifying each members roles, describing the focus of each phase of the software development life-cycle, and identifying the major risks.

Another major portion of my 403 time went to meetings. There were about 5 or 6 meetings this week, and I went to all of them. The first couple were group meetings where we discussed who would work on what for assignment 2, further defined the product we were planning to build (features, functions, platform, etc.), and general role responsibilities (who was working on front-end vs. back-end). We also had two meetings with our clients, one with the TA client and the other with our student group client. Both of these meetings proved to be very useful, as we were given a lot of good feedback, especially in regards to similar existing apps, and how we could change our app to make it unique. We also had a meeting with the group we were clients of. Everybody from our group tried to give the best feedback we could, but that group has a 'real' client and already had a lot of their requirements nailed down.

The last group meeting was spent getting everybody on the same page in regards to the project description and tools (mercurial, wiki, dropbox and google docs). The group is now able to write code and keep it under version control.

My plans for next week:

  * Start looking at Facebook API
  * Get familiar with PHP
  * Look at what our database options are for the back-end and start the architecture.
  * Help with paper prototype

My goal from last week (although this is the first individual status report) was to understand our version control system (Mercurial) and the Facebook API. We should have set up version control, and synced everything up among everyone. Also, I should have reviewed the API, compared it to what I already know about web development, and identified parts of it that might require more learning than others.

We set up Google Code and moved all of our information there, so everything is in one (version controlled) place now. I helped move over data from Google docs to the wiki. I also updated two of our use cases to reflect changes in our product. Having everything in one place makes the complexity of the development process seem a lot less intimidating.

My plans for next week are...
  * Go over the Facebook API and identify elements that will (might?) be important to our product
  * Refine (and augment) use cases to better reflect the new bartering system

**Jedidiah Jonathan**

This was the first week as a group and almost all the team meetings were to come onto the same page as a group. Early during the week, I meet with the team members to brain storm ideas for the product description. We came up with a proposal that was presented to the group and our customers. I was really surprised by our later discoveries of the current alternatives that solve the problem that we were addressing in this project. I worked with James on the laying a solid foundation for the product description. And as the team kept meeting the customers we had new developements that meant we have to go and edit our product description again. Also played around with the Facebook app that does "sharing books".

Tasks Completed Sucessfully:
  * Basic outline and structure of the product description.
  * Work with the team to setup Dropbox and learn basic tools to use the wiki and stuff.
  * Meet both our customers this week and get some really good constructive feedback from them.

Tasks TODO:
  * Learn to use Crystal and Mercurial.
  * Finish the product description for review by teammates and final submission on Monday 4/11.
  * Talk to the team to take on new tasks.
  * I also missed a team meeting today (Sunday) need to touch base with the team members, study the meeting minutes and get back on track with the rest of the team on the current project status.
