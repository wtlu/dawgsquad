## This Week's Progress ##

This week the D.A.W.G. Squad mainly focused on our release candidate version of SharingMedia. Since we finished all of the features we feel were necessary, the week was focused on improving user experience and refactoring code.

We conducted 5 user tests with people with non-computing careers. We ended up finding many things that we could improve on in terms of our usability. The transaction part of our application was improved upon the most as it seems to confuse all of our test subjects.

The testing team (Greg, Jedidiah, Tatsuro) also performed a code review on our application and gave some good comments for the developers. Among the top priority was to fix the comments (because many of the controllers were void of them) and how the code was not adhering to CakePHP standards. The developers tried the best they could to refactor the code, but with current UI bugs and other enhancements, only some refactoring process was made.


## Next Week's Goals ##

For next week, D.A.W.G. Squad plans to:
  * Complete and release version 1.0 of our product
    * Fix all bugs or mark them as "Won't Fix" (Everyone)
    * Update Schedule(Everyone)
    * Write Postmortem Document (Wei-Ting)
    * Making sure our application passes tests written by testers (Everyone)
  * Update SRS, SDS, User, Dev Docs (Wei-Ting)
  * Finish and turn in Release 1.0 (Everyone)
