# User Testing 5-27-2011 #

We conducted a user test during the week of May 22 to May 28, 2011. We wanted to see if our product created any usability problems and finding recommendations on how to create a better user experience.

## Design ##

We conducted our user test similar to our paper prototype. We had the test subjects go through our main use cases: Adding Books, Finding Books, and Performing Transactions. We had our subjects think aloud while they were performing these tasks. We did not provide feedback to them. We took notes as they interacted with our application and went through the three use cases. For “Adding Books”, we asked our test subjects to go through the process of adding a book. For “Finding Books”, we asked our test subjects to go through and find the book “Harry Potter” which was a book that we had, and perform a transaction. Lastly we had them roam around the application as they pleased.

## Test Subjects ##

We did our user test on 5 different users. Below are details of our users:
| **Subject Name** | **Background** |
|:-----------------|:---------------|
| Jabili Kaza | Human Centered Design and Engineering |
| Ryosuke Oya | Mechanical Engineering |
| Jonathan Eric Kam | Korean Studies |
| Andrew Poleon | Math and Economics |
| Justin Hanson | Business - Finance |

## Findings ##


The general overall consensus was positive. Users generally did not have trouble adding books into their library. Some users were annoyed that they could not find the book they’re looking for, but in the end, did not have trouble adding the book after finding them. However in the “Adding Initial Offers” page, many have suggested to put the unit of transactions next to “Loan” and “Sell” so they don’t have to guess days and dollars. From this we found that the user did not really want to read directions, and only read if it’s a necessity.

There wasn’t much explanation on what the tabs mean in the “My Library” page were, and only after stumbling around they got a general idea how it works, but were still unsure. One user did seek help from the user documentation, and were pleased to find the directions informative. However, most users did try to read the help documentation and instead wanted to play around the application on their own.

We have found that everyone had a little trouble understanding what “Transaction” really means and how the process worked. They thought there was little explanation on how the process worked, and how they would get the books. Everyone consistently was confused on the wording in the “Counter Offer” page as they didn’t know who was doing the action of “Loaning” “Selling” and “Trading”.

## Recommendation and Changes ##

Based on the feedback we got from our user, we went ahead and made some changes so it would hopefully change the user experience for the better. In the “Add Initial Offers” page, we changed the layout so that it now says “Long for (days)?” “Sell for how much?” instead of just “Loan for?” and “Sell for?” to make it the text input clearer to the user. In the “My Library” page, there are now descriptions underneath the title to dictate what each tab pages mean when user navigates to the page. “My Transactions” has been renamed to “Transaction History” to reflect more clearly what the information contains. Each of the status in the transaction and loans are also color coded to give the user a visual cue on what the states of the transactions are (such as blue for pending and waiting for the action of the user, white for completed transactions, and orange for pending, but waiting for the other user to respond. We also changed  the layout of the main page so it’s more prominent to the user.
